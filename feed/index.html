<p>When creating any kind of standardized test, one of the main goals is to avoid any potential bias in the results; the questions should be consistent and fair, with a concentrated focus on the subject matter. To help achieve this goal, the CodeSignal team has conducted extensive research on test design, and developed a framework for creating new tasks.<br></p>



<p>As a result of this research, the team can make confident assertions regarding the length and content of a technical assessment. For example, it’s been shown that the ideal test length is around 60 minutes (if the test is shorter, it can limit the quality and accuracy of the signal it’s providing, while a longer test can lead to candidate dropoff). Furthermore, questions can be categorized according to meaningful distinctions in their complexity; for example, there should be tasks that simply assess language familiarity, without asking the candidate to implement any complicated algorithms or data structures. There’s also a distinction between implementation tasks (which describe the exact instructions to follow) vs problem solving tasks, which describe the given scenario but leave it up to the candidate how to solve the problem.<br></p>

<p>As we’ve seen in previous tasks, one of the main strengths and focuses of the CodeSignal platform is its ability to provide <strong>targeted assessment</strong> &#8211; to zoom right in on a concept without noise or interference in the results.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>In this episode, we’re specifically covering a task related to asynchronous code, an important concept in situations where timing is important. We might use async when dealing with database queries, API calls, or the complicated interaction of the many moving parts within a typical web app. It’s worth noting that all of these can be simulated on CodeSignal, but in this case since we’re trying to assess for the candidate’s ability to write async code, that’s the sole focus of this task.<br></p>



<p>For some engineering leads, this level of proficiency is all a candidate will need to prove in order to show that they’re qualified. For other jobs, they may be looking for someone with a deeper contextual understanding, in which case this task could be used to screen out unqualified candidates, without wasting anyone’s time on the more complicated follow-up task.<br></p>



<p>To ensure that the timing of the code is unaffected by external factors (such as processor speed or connection quality), the code is run on a dedicated coderunner server. This is true of all CodeSignal tasks, but it’s of particular importance in this case, since this kind of task relies on strict timing.<br></p>

<h4><strong>CodeSignal has officially launched Certify out of beta and into the real world! Try Certify today yourself.</strong></h4>



<p>Are you hiring a ton of engineers? Looking to recruit new technical talent from universities? Or, do you simply have so much demand for your open positions it’s hard to find the best candidates?</p>



<p>Certify, CodeSignal’s top-of-funnel testing solution, is designed for you. Much like the SAT or TOEFL, CodeSignal’s Certify technical skills assessment solution enables organizations to standardize skill measurement across every candidate, resulting in more efficient and consistent testing results. Rather than relying on proxies like years of experience or even the name of university someone graduated from, Certify allows recruiters and hiring managers to calibrate candidates while introducing objectivity into the early stage of hiring. </p>



<p>Many leading tech companies like Quora, Robinhood, eBay, and Postmates have already found great success by introducing Certify into their hiring process &#8212; especially for high-volume positions such as new grad software engineers or software engineering interns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s what a few folks had to say about implementing Certify:&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><a href="https://www.g2.com/products/codesignal/reviews/codesignal-review-2588194#survey-response-2588194" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://codesignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Testimonial_1-1-1024x344.jpg" alt="Phenomenal assessment solution especially for university recruiting!
 
The ability to send out a standardized assessment and get certified results back has made our university recruiting process a joy. Before CodeSignal, we were forced to review thousands of student resumes, discard most of them for very subjective reasons and send the rest to be reviewed by our hiring managers. 

Now we send everyone who applies or expresses interest in the company a CodeSignal Certification request and based on their Coding Score we move them to an onsite interview. How beautiful is that? Saves us a lot of engineering and recruiting time and finds for us hidden gems that we would have never been able to find purely based on resumes.

<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><a href="https://www.g2.com/products/codesignal/reviews/codesignal-review-2342437" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://codesignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Testimonial_2-1-1024x244.jpg" alt="Find candidates we wouldn’t have considered otherwise
 
What I like the most is the ability to put the assessments at the very top of the funnel and find candidates we wouldn't have considered otherwise. It's not only the right thing to do but has helped us scale our top of the funnel without spending a lot of time and money with expensive recruiting agencies. We just advertise our job posting on all platforms, get thousands of candidates and then ask them to complete a General Coding Assessment through CodeSignal." class="wp-image-2937" width="768" height="183" srcset="https://codesignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Testimonial_2-1-1024x244.jpg 1024w, https://codesignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Testimonial_2-1-300x71.jpg 300w, https://codesignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Testimonial_2-1-768x183.jpg 768w, https://codesignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Testimonial_2-1.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></a></figure>

The ability to see someone’s true technical ability without having to rely on their resume has been eye opening. Before using CodeSignal, we would reject more than 97% of all of our applicants based on their resumes. Now everyone goes through a CodeSignal certification and we’ve been able to find amazing team members who wouldn’t ever get the interview in our old flow." class="wp-image-2938" width="768" height="183" srcset="https://codesignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Testimonial_3-1-1024x244.jpg 1024w, https://codesignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Testimonial_3-1-300x71.jpg 300w, https://codesignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Testimonial_3-1-768x183.jpg 768w, https://codesignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Testimonial_3-1.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></a></figure>



<p> </p>



<p>As of today, we’ve officially launched Certify out of beta and into the real world. This means this powerful solution is now available to any teams or companies instead of a select group of existing CodeSignal customers.</p>



<p>The best part? You can create a user account on your own and start using Certify right away!&nbsp;</p>



<h3><b>Getting Started with CodeSignal’s Certify</b></h3>



<p>Before you (and we) get ahead of ourselves, let’s talk about what Certify is and how it enables hiring teams to focus on qualified candidates, minimize hiring bias, and save time by automating the assessment process. </p>



<p>You can watch this video for an introduction to Certify.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="position: relative; padding-top: 56.25%; width: 100%; margin-bottom: 20px;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JbLTmnS5oMY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><a href="https://app.codesignal.com/company/signup?isSelfService=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://codesignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/banner_getstarted-1-1024x289.png" alt="Sign up for free and check out the tutorial" class="wp-image-2947" width="1024" height="289" srcset="https://codesignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/banner_getstarted-1-1024x289.png 1024w, https://codesignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/banner_getstarted-1-300x85.png 300w, https://codesignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/banner_getstarted-1-768x217.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></a></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The official launch of Certify includes robust enhancements with a focus on enterprise clients, including Applicant Tracking System (ATS) integrations with most popular ATS providers, automated virtual proctoring functionality to eliminate false positives, an API for sending and receiving certified assessments programmatically and Single Sign On (SSO) features that support all standard SSO protocols.</p>



<p>If you haven’t implemented assessments into your hiring process, Certify is an easy way to get started today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since Certify sits at the top of the funnel for a high-volume funnel, you can immediately see results from implementing this assessment solution. Monitor your funnel conversion rate and speed for the end-to-end engineering hiring process. You will save time and hire candidates with the right technical skills your team needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’ve already implemented assessments into your hiring process, we ask that you ask yourself one question: Is my current assessment process able to produce consistent results while ensuring EEOC compliance?</p>



<p>It’s that second part that can be tricky. It’s why all of our assessments are based around our proprietary assessment framework.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><b>Implement Technical Skill Assessments with Certify Today</b></h3>



<p>Hiring engineers doesn’t have to be hard. By implementing assessments, hiring teams save time, reduce hiring bias, and ensure candidates have the real skills needed to get the job done. Certify is the first technical assessment product that can be used at the very top of the hiring funnel allowing talent acquisition professionals and engineering managers to request and compare unbiased and easy-to-understand assessment results at scale to make data-driven hiring decisions<br>To get started, you can sign up for Certify <a href="http://codesignal.com/try-certify?utm_source=blog">here</a>.</p>

<p>One of the big strengths of the CodeSignal platform is the consistency and simplicity of the UI; the theme and layout can be customized to the candidate’s needs, and regardless of the task type, users know where to find the description, tests, and coding area. Furthermore, experienced devs will find the coding experience familiar, as they’re able to select from classic text editors such as Vim, Sublime text, and Emacs.<br></p>



<p>In this episode, we look at a data analysis task, which is quite different from previous types of tasks, but despite this, the appearance is familiar and inviting. In order to solve this task, the candidate would need to interact with a database and an API using a programming language (rather than simply writing queries, as we’ve seen in previous tasks). The idea is to more accurately emulate the workflow of a backend developer, who may need to import various libraries, and pull in data from diverse sources.<br></p>



<p>To avoid usage limitations or other potential complications, the simulated API lives on the CodeSignal server, but the candidate can interact with it as they would with a real API. It can also be configured to return errors occasionally, to ensure that the candidate’s code is robust enough to handle these instances. Finally, because Docker is used to manage the coderunner server, the simulated API and database can be setup and destroyed very quickly.<br></p>

<p>In a previous episode we looked at how CodeSignal can evaluate a front-end user interface task involving React; this time, we check out an example written in classic JavaScript. The particular task we explored is focused on the candidate’s JavaScript abilities within the web environment, so the HTML and CSS files are provided as boilerplate. This provides more targeted assessment, while cutting down on the candidate’s time commitment. Furthermore, this task is technically labelled as a <strong>recovery</strong> type (as seen in episode 7), which means that even in a multi-file environment, we can control which parts of the code can be modified by the user (in this case, the whole .js file).<br></p>



<p>Similar to other front-end tasks, the tests are administered using a selenium browser, which renders the page within the DOM, allowing it to check if the elements’ properties are within expected ranges. Since this project involves a .js file, the selenium browser can also interact with the page and check if it’s having the intended effect on other elements. And since each of these interactions can be separated into distinct tests, the user gets detailed information on what they were able to do correctly and what still needs to be done. This has additional benefits to hiring managers, as they receive a more detailed understanding of how the candidate performed (eg: they passed 75% of the tests, rather than a simple pass or fail result).<br></p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><iframe style="width: 740px; height: 416px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y0j2IMaDnSU" width="740" height="416" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></figure>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michael Newman, Director of Engineering at CodeSignal, joined the podcast today to share his experiences as an engineering manager, before having technical assessment tools and after.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->


<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michael shares the difficulty of trying to predict how people are going to do at each stage of the interview process. With so many candidates and varying qualification levels, it&#8217;s easy to spend a lot of the team&#8217;s time trying to determine who will stand out. With assessments, you&#8217;re looking to automatically determine whether someone is going to do well at each step.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A good place to start when hiring engineers is to identify, as a team, what you are looking for specifically. It&#8217;s important to determine what attributes are essential in a candidate, like coding, problem-solving, communication and the ability to learn new things. Once you identify those attributes, you can understand what attributes are less important, like prior familiarity with a program or framework.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As Michael explains, when you have a strong candidate who can learn new things and communicate well, they can pick up a new skill quickly. This is the challenge with resume-based recruiting. A resume highlights things like the exact language or programs someone has used but can&#8217;t communicate how bright a candidate may be or their ability to learn quickly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Michael, it&#8217;s important to know what you want to measure ahead of time and set a goal for what you&#8217;re trying to learn at each step of the process. Each step should be an indicator of how the candidate will progress. By the end of each stage, you should be able to decide whether or not that candidate advances. And at the end of all the steps, the team can be confident that hiring a particular candidate is the right choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each stage having a purpose begins with the initial assessment that measures a direct skill. If the candidate has the right skills, they will progress to the next step, such as a phone interview. The first interview is a great time to measure another skill, like the candidate&#8217;s ability to communicate effectively. With an onsite interview, the spectrum is wider, and candidates might be assessed on their ability to learn and complete a realistic project quickly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Michael, almost <em>everyone</em> should be invited to complete the initial skills-based assessment. Outside of an obvious mismatch, like an applicant that wants an internship or doesn&#8217;t graduate for a year, everyone gets a chance to show their skills. There are no filters related to schools or other proxies. Michael finds that candidates who perform well throughout the interview process often don&#8217;t come from a traditional path and wouldn&#8217;t have had a &#8220;perfect&#8221; resume for the role.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So how can you leverage Michael&#8217;s experience and apply it to your hiring process? He recommends the following: know what you&#8217;re trying to measure from the beginning, set a goal for each stage, be careful not to waste candidate&#8217;s time and stay open. Some of the best people he&#8217;s ever worked with came from various backgrounds and likely would not have been given a chance with the outdated resume recruiting process.</p>

<p><strong>Bugfix</strong> is one of the classic types of tasks on CodeSignal. This type of task involves finding and correcting a single mistake within an otherwise correct block of pre-written code. This allows the candidate to provide a signal of their understanding in a shorter period of time, since they don’t have to write all of the code themselves.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This kind of task can also be used to assess a candidate’s code review skills, which can be another important part of the real-world dev experience. Even if the candidate would be able to solve the task by rewriting their own algorithm, bugfix tasks allow them to change only one line, so they have no choice but to engage with the reasoning of the dev who originally wrote the code.<br></p>



<p>As an additional anti-cheat measure, there’s a limit to how many characters the candidate can modify, based on the size of the expected solution (with some padding). Furthermore, these checks are administered on the client end, so the code won’t even be sent to the coderunner server if too much of the original code has been modified.<br></p>

<p>One of the main strengths of the CodeSignal platform is that it can provide a quick signal of a candidate’s abilities. This has evident advantages for the recruiter, and it also improves the candidate experience, as their time isn’t wasted.<br></p>



<p>If you’re looking to hire someone to work with a particular language, framework, or tool, you can use multiple choice quiz questions to very quickly check their level of understanding. This can be useful for screening purposes, so that the candidates advancing to code-writing tasks will have already demonstrated the required baseline familiarity.<br></p>



<p>These kinds of questions support markdown, so both the questions and answers can include code, images, and other forms of stylization. This allows us to construct questions that can’t easily be solved by google searching. As an additional anti-cheating measure, copy-pasting is disabled, so that the candidate wouldn’t be able to simply copy and run a given block of code. Furthermore, these are usually presented as a group of around 15 questions, with a time limit for completing the whole test.<br></p>



<p>The CodeSignal library features hundreds of these types of questions, covering specific technologies like React or Android, as well as broader concepts like machine learning or object-oriented programming. Additionally, as we’ll see in a future episode, the process of creating a new quiz question is very simple and straightforward.<br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, we&#8217;ll unpack the top five mistakes we see in technical recruiting, starting with number five.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Number Five &#8211; </strong>Looking at resumes before conducting a technical interview.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A technical interview measures technical ability. You don&#8217;t need to know what school a candidate went to or any other details that can introduce bias upfront. Avoid the invitation for unconscious bias by skipping the initial resume review.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Number Four</strong> &#8211; Not having a clear plan for which interviewer measures which skill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This mistake occurs during onsite interviews, where often three to five engineers are going to be conducting their own interview with the candidate. Companies who don&#8217;t have a lot of experience with this might ask each interviewer to come up with their own questions, meet with the candidate and then regroup as a team to discuss. This creates an overlap on the skills that were measured and not enough wide coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Measuring a candidate&#8217;s ability to write JavaScript, for example, includes more than measuring general ability. It involves problem-solving skills, their quality of code and more. Figure out what matters <em>in advance</em> and assign each interviewer a specific section to assess. When the team gets back together, you have a full picture of the candidate and their skill level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Number Three</strong> &#8211; Letting interviewers see each other&#8217;s feedback before writing their own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a huge problem that&#8217;s easy to overlook because we don&#8217;t understand just how much other people&#8217;s opinions influence our own. Although it&#8217;s a common problem, interviewers can avoid it by formulating a personal opinion before reading anyone else&#8217;s. Almost every applicant tracking system has a permissions selection to hide other interviewer feedback. Be sure to utilize this to avoid being influenced. The best team decisions are made when everyone starts with their own independent views.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Number Two</strong> &#8211; Giving open-ended take-home assessments. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An open-ended assessment typically happens before an onsite interview. The candidate will likely be given a project with instructions that include a statement like, &#8220;Most candidates take approximately two hours to complete this assignment.&#8221; Some candidates will listen to that and stop precisely at two hours, investing the exact amount of time necessary. Others may take two days to complete the same assessment, just to be sure they can compete and show their skills. For those that take longer, getting a generic response that they&#8217;ve been rejected after so much effort, can be a debilitating experience. And ultimately, it&#8217;s not a true assessment because it&#8217;s open to interpretation by the candidate. Be clear and the experience (and assessment results) will be fair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Number One</strong> &#8211; Making resume review the first step of the hiring process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Resume reviews are inherently biased. And 90-95% of candidates are submitting a resume that is not going to stand out. Recruiters acknowledge that the top of the funnel is the biggest problem in hiring, so rejecting the majority at that step, defeats the process. Start with what candidates can do and assess their skills, whether you&#8217;re hiring early talent or more veteran applicants.</p>
