<p>When creating any kind of standardized test, one of the main goals is to avoid any potential bias in the results; the questions should be consistent and fair, with a concentrated focus on the subject matter. To help achieve this goal, the CodeSignal team has conducted extensive research on test design, and developed a framework for creating new tasks.<br></p>



<p>As a result of this research, the team can make confident assertions regarding the length and content of a technical assessment. For example, it’s been shown that the ideal test length is around 60 minutes (if the test is shorter, it can limit the quality and accuracy of the signal it’s providing, while a longer test can lead to candidate dropoff). Furthermore, questions can be categorized according to meaningful distinctions in their complexity; for example, there should be tasks that simply assess language familiarity, without asking the candidate to implement any complicated algorithms or data structures. There’s also a distinction between implementation tasks (which describe the exact instructions to follow) vs problem solving tasks, which describe the given scenario but leave it up to the candidate how to solve the problem.<br></p>

<p>As we’ve seen in previous tasks, one of the main strengths and focuses of the CodeSignal platform is its ability to provide <strong>targeted assessment</strong> &#8211; to zoom right in on a concept without noise or interference in the results.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>In this episode, we’re specifically covering a task related to asynchronous code, an important concept in situations where timing is important. We might use async when dealing with database queries, API calls, or the complicated interaction of the many moving parts within a typical web app. It’s worth noting that all of these can be simulated on CodeSignal, but in this case since we’re trying to assess for the candidate’s ability to write async code, that’s the sole focus of this task.<br></p>



<p>For some engineering leads, this level of proficiency is all a candidate will need to prove in order to show that they’re qualified. For other jobs, they may be looking for someone with a deeper contextual understanding, in which case this task could be used to screen out unqualified candidates, without wasting anyone’s time on the more complicated follow-up task.<br></p>



<p>To ensure that the timing of the code is unaffected by external factors (such as processor speed or connection quality), the code is run on a dedicated coderunner server. This is true of all CodeSignal tasks, but it’s of particular importance in this case, since this kind of task relies on strict timing.<br></p>

<p>One of the big strengths of the CodeSignal platform is the consistency and simplicity of the UI; the theme and layout can be customized to the candidate’s needs, and regardless of the task type, users know where to find the description, tests, and coding area. Furthermore, experienced devs will find the coding experience familiar, as they’re able to select from classic text editors such as Vim, Sublime text, and Emacs.<br></p>



<p>In this episode, we look at a data analysis task, which is quite different from previous types of tasks, but despite this, the appearance is familiar and inviting. In order to solve this task, the candidate would need to interact with a database and an API using a programming language (rather than simply writing queries, as we’ve seen in previous tasks). The idea is to more accurately emulate the workflow of a backend developer, who may need to import various libraries, and pull in data from diverse sources.<br></p>



<p>To avoid usage limitations or other potential complications, the simulated API lives on the CodeSignal server, but the candidate can interact with it as they would with a real API. It can also be configured to return errors occasionally, to ensure that the candidate’s code is robust enough to handle these instances. Finally, because Docker is used to manage the coderunner server, the simulated API and database can be setup and destroyed very quickly.<br></p>

<p>In a previous episode we looked at how CodeSignal can evaluate a front-end user interface task involving React; this time, we check out an example written in classic JavaScript. The particular task we explored is focused on the candidate’s JavaScript abilities within the web environment, so the HTML and CSS files are provided as boilerplate. This provides more targeted assessment, while cutting down on the candidate’s time commitment. Furthermore, this task is technically labelled as a <strong>recovery</strong> type (as seen in episode 7), which means that even in a multi-file environment, we can control which parts of the code can be modified by the user (in this case, the whole .js file).<br></p>



<p>Similar to other front-end tasks, the tests are administered using a selenium browser, which renders the page within the DOM, allowing it to check if the elements’ properties are within expected ranges. Since this project involves a .js file, the selenium browser can also interact with the page and check if it’s having the intended effect on other elements. And since each of these interactions can be separated into distinct tests, the user gets detailed information on what they were able to do correctly and what still needs to be done. This has additional benefits to hiring managers, as they receive a more detailed understanding of how the candidate performed (eg: they passed 75% of the tests, rather than a simple pass or fail result).<br></p>

<p><strong>Bugfix</strong> is one of the classic types of tasks on CodeSignal. This type of task involves finding and correcting a single mistake within an otherwise correct block of pre-written code. This allows the candidate to provide a signal of their understanding in a shorter period of time, since they don’t have to write all of the code themselves.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This kind of task can also be used to assess a candidate’s code review skills, which can be another important part of the real-world dev experience. Even if the candidate would be able to solve the task by rewriting their own algorithm, bugfix tasks allow them to change only one line, so they have no choice but to engage with the reasoning of the dev who originally wrote the code.<br></p>



<p>As an additional anti-cheat measure, there’s a limit to how many characters the candidate can modify, based on the size of the expected solution (with some padding). Furthermore, these checks are administered on the client end, so the code won’t even be sent to the coderunner server if too much of the original code has been modified.<br></p>

<p>One of the main strengths of the CodeSignal platform is that it can provide a quick signal of a candidate’s abilities. This has evident advantages for the recruiter, and it also improves the candidate experience, as their time isn’t wasted.<br></p>



<p>If you’re looking to hire someone to work with a particular language, framework, or tool, you can use multiple choice quiz questions to very quickly check their level of understanding. This can be useful for screening purposes, so that the candidates advancing to code-writing tasks will have already demonstrated the required baseline familiarity.<br></p>



<p>These kinds of questions support markdown, so both the questions and answers can include code, images, and other forms of stylization. This allows us to construct questions that can’t easily be solved by google searching. As an additional anti-cheating measure, copy-pasting is disabled, so that the candidate wouldn’t be able to simply copy and run a given block of code. Furthermore, these are usually presented as a group of around 15 questions, with a time limit for completing the whole test.<br></p>



<p>The CodeSignal library features hundreds of these types of questions, covering specific technologies like React or Android, as well as broader concepts like machine learning or object-oriented programming. Additionally, as we’ll see in a future episode, the process of creating a new quiz question is very simple and straightforward.<br></p>

<p>When a candidate has made it past the initial screening process, we’d typically like to take a closer look at their work, so there’s less of a need for automated testing. In this episode we look at a type of task that assesses a candidate’s ability to write tests using a testing framework, and then use them to write and validate a corresponding algorithm.<br></p>



<p>In this particular case, this task uses RSpec, a testing framework for Ruby which is one among many tools and frameworks supported by the CodeSignal platform. The candidate’s ability to write their tests in this case is just as important as their ability to write a solution.<br></p>



<p>Since the candidate is writing both the tests and the solution, this type of task would need to be verified manually by a recruiter, who would assess them based on their adherence to test-driven development principles. Although this type of task is less automated, it very closely resembles the real world developer experience, which makes it a good fit for candidates who have made it further down the hiring funnel.<br></p>

<p>In this episode we revisited the same file system task that we saw last time, but with a focus on how the tests work. The main distinguishing feature of these tasks is that the tests are stored within the project’s file tree, similar to how a software engineer would write tests. Furthermore, the tests can be written to have any kind of interaction with the app, rather than just providing a set of inputs and expected outputs for a single function.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>On a technical level, the tests are executed by zipping the whole file system, and sending it to a coderunner server which then runs the tests and returns a report on the results. The candidate is scored on how many of the tests they passed, similar to the way most other types of tasks are scored.<br></p>



<p>From the candidate’s perspective, the feedback is presented in the same format as a standard algorithmic task, with familiar error reporting in the console. It’s also possible for some of the tests to be hidden, as they can be stored in different files with different user permissions. This allows the tests to contain edge cases that the user would need to consider in order to pass all the hidden tests.<br></p>

<p>Continuing the theme of showcasing tasks that emulate the real dev experience, we look at a <strong>file system</strong> task in this episode. In this type of task, all of the code lives in an extensible tree of files, similar to the structure of a web app.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>For a standard algorithmic task, the tests normally supply a sample input and an expected output, but the tests for this type of task are stored in files, and administered as unit tests (again, similar to how we might test the functionality of a web app). This allows for more flexibility in the types of tests we can write; for example, a unit test might instantiate a class, invoke some of the resulting object’s methods, and then compare its properties to an expected result.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The unit tests can be designed to each check a specific function or edge case, thus providing the candidate with clear feedback, and providing the recruiter with meaningful data. And like most other tasks, half of the tests are hidden to the candidate in order to prevent the possibility of cheating, reducing noise or inaccuracy in the results of the automated assessment.<br></p>

<p>In the previous two episodes we looked at ways to zoom in and isolate a particular skill, though in reality, many developer positions will involve a diverse set of responsibilities. For example, a back end dev’s job will likely consist of more than just writing SQL queries, so to more accurately simulate the experience, this task involves making an API call, and then querying a database through a programming language.<br></p>



<p>Because some API’s will limit access, cost money to use, or just generally take a long time, these types of tasks use an internal CodeSignal API to simulate the process. The user can interact with this internal API using the same syntax, but without encountering any of the previously mentioned issues.<br></p>



<p>It’s also worth mentioning that the CodeSignal platform supports the use of 40 different programming languages, though we can restrict the options if we’re looking for someone proficient in a particular language.<br></p>
