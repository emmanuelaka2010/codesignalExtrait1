<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><iframe style="width: 740px; height: 416px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y0j2IMaDnSU" width="740" height="416" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></figure>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michael Newman, Director of Engineering at CodeSignal, joined the podcast today to share his experiences as an engineering manager, before having technical assessment tools and after.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->


<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michael shares the difficulty of trying to predict how people are going to do at each stage of the interview process. With so many candidates and varying qualification levels, it&#8217;s easy to spend a lot of the team&#8217;s time trying to determine who will stand out. With assessments, you&#8217;re looking to automatically determine whether someone is going to do well at each step.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A good place to start when hiring engineers is to identify, as a team, what you are looking for specifically. It&#8217;s important to determine what attributes are essential in a candidate, like coding, problem-solving, communication and the ability to learn new things. Once you identify those attributes, you can understand what attributes are less important, like prior familiarity with a program or framework.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As Michael explains, when you have a strong candidate who can learn new things and communicate well, they can pick up a new skill quickly. This is the challenge with resume-based recruiting. A resume highlights things like the exact language or programs someone has used but can&#8217;t communicate how bright a candidate may be or their ability to learn quickly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Michael, it&#8217;s important to know what you want to measure ahead of time and set a goal for what you&#8217;re trying to learn at each step of the process. Each step should be an indicator of how the candidate will progress. By the end of each stage, you should be able to decide whether or not that candidate advances. And at the end of all the steps, the team can be confident that hiring a particular candidate is the right choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each stage having a purpose begins with the initial assessment that measures a direct skill. If the candidate has the right skills, they will progress to the next step, such as a phone interview. The first interview is a great time to measure another skill, like the candidate&#8217;s ability to communicate effectively. With an onsite interview, the spectrum is wider, and candidates might be assessed on their ability to learn and complete a realistic project quickly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Michael, almost <em>everyone</em> should be invited to complete the initial skills-based assessment. Outside of an obvious mismatch, like an applicant that wants an internship or doesn&#8217;t graduate for a year, everyone gets a chance to show their skills. There are no filters related to schools or other proxies. Michael finds that candidates who perform well throughout the interview process often don&#8217;t come from a traditional path and wouldn&#8217;t have had a &#8220;perfect&#8221; resume for the role.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So how can you leverage Michael&#8217;s experience and apply it to your hiring process? He recommends the following: know what you&#8217;re trying to measure from the beginning, set a goal for each stage, be careful not to waste candidate&#8217;s time and stay open. Some of the best people he&#8217;s ever worked with came from various backgrounds and likely would not have been given a chance with the outdated resume recruiting process.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><iframe style="width: 740px; height: 416px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dpAz3SzulRs" width="740" height="416" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></figure>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, we&#8217;ll unpack the top five mistakes we see in technical recruiting, starting with number five.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Number Five &#8211; </strong>Looking at resumes before conducting a technical interview.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A technical interview measures technical ability. You don&#8217;t need to know what school a candidate went to or any other details that can introduce bias upfront. Avoid the invitation for unconscious bias by skipping the initial resume review.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Number Four</strong> &#8211; Not having a clear plan for which interviewer measures which skill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This mistake occurs during onsite interviews, where often three to five engineers are going to be conducting their own interview with the candidate. Companies who don&#8217;t have a lot of experience with this might ask each interviewer to come up with their own questions, meet with the candidate and then regroup as a team to discuss. This creates an overlap on the skills that were measured and not enough wide coverage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Measuring a candidate&#8217;s ability to write JavaScript, for example, includes more than measuring general ability. It involves problem-solving skills, their quality of code and more. Figure out what matters <em>in advance</em> and assign each interviewer a specific section to assess. When the team gets back together, you have a full picture of the candidate and their skill level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Number Three</strong> &#8211; Letting interviewers see each other&#8217;s feedback before writing their own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a huge problem that&#8217;s easy to overlook because we don&#8217;t understand just how much other people&#8217;s opinions influence our own. Although it&#8217;s a common problem, interviewers can avoid it by formulating a personal opinion before reading anyone else&#8217;s. Almost every applicant tracking system has a permissions selection to hide other interviewer feedback. Be sure to utilize this to avoid being influenced. The best team decisions are made when everyone starts with their own independent views.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Number Two</strong> &#8211; Giving open-ended take-home assessments. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An open-ended assessment typically happens before an onsite interview. The candidate will likely be given a project with instructions that include a statement like, &#8220;Most candidates take approximately two hours to complete this assignment.&#8221; Some candidates will listen to that and stop precisely at two hours, investing the exact amount of time necessary. Others may take two days to complete the same assessment, just to be sure they can compete and show their skills. For those that take longer, getting a generic response that they&#8217;ve been rejected after so much effort, can be a debilitating experience. And ultimately, it&#8217;s not a true assessment because it&#8217;s open to interpretation by the candidate. Be clear and the experience (and assessment results) will be fair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Number One</strong> &#8211; Making resume review the first step of the hiring process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Resume reviews are inherently biased. And 90-95% of candidates are submitting a resume that is not going to stand out. Recruiters acknowledge that the top of the funnel is the biggest problem in hiring, so rejecting the majority at that step, defeats the process. Start with what candidates can do and assess their skills, whether you&#8217;re hiring early talent or more veteran applicants.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><iframe style="width: 740px; height: 416px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mNbzRWmIatI" width="740" height="416" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></figure>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best way to understand early technical hiring is by the numbers. With the utilization of LinkedIn data, we can determine where candidates went to school, and subsequently, where they are going to work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A report of 2018 graduates with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in Computer Science or Computer Engineering netted about 70,000. That number indicates a 20-30% growth rate of these degrees year over year. But, it&#8217;s important to note that these degrees aren&#8217;t <em>suddenly</em> more desirable to incoming freshmen. The growth in these degrees represents an increasing need in those fields.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Out of the sample group, about 60% are working in the tech industry, and 5% are in finance. The rest are divided across different sectors. What was surprising about the low finance percentage is that it comes as the industry continues to discuss increasing security needs and high-tech offerings. It seems as though the idea of a high-tech financial world is in the beginning stages, based on these numbers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Companies that represent the top 20-25% answer the question of who hires the most new graduates in the category. As expected, the largest are the tech giants; the Facebooks, Amazons and Googles of the world. These big organizations hire about 1,000 from the total pool. Large firms like Capital One and Goldman Sachs still find their way to the top of the list, employing about 500 of the overall pool. What may come as a surprise is the number of consulting firms that make it onto the list. The need to support their clients with technical services is driving the demand for more technically savvy consultants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One interesting stat shows that Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook combined, hire over 10% of new graduates. When these companies are asked directly, they believe they hire only the top 2%.  But, the numbers don&#8217;t lie, and someone is hiring deeper into the curve. So, is there a specific concentration of schools? Theoretically, the number of recruits could come from a small group of Universities. We&#8217;ll cover this in a future post, as we dig deeper into the data.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What we haven&#8217;t considered with this data is the part-time or contractor positions, which is a common status in the IT fields. The relative number of 70,000 undoubtedly doesn&#8217;t cover all the new men and women entering the IT field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What we can confirm is that the tech industry is growing fast and there is increasing competition from all angles. Today, graduating in Computer Science or Computer Engineering doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you&#8217;ll end up in the field. With the continued disruption in technology, the skills are growing in demand, equating to a new type of literacy.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The democratization of education is here. So, what exactly does that mean for recruiting? Whether we realize it or not, education has had and continues to have a significant impact on hiring. It&#8217;s not always easy to see the connection, and that&#8217;s because it takes a while for it to propagate.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take the current day reliance on pedigrees, like graduating from a top tier school. That may have been an important requirement for getting a job in the past. But with the internet boom we&#8217;ve seen over the past twenty years, educational resources have changed. Valid education opportunities are available to everyone who has internet access, not just the lucky few who received a coveted acceptance letter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Previously, individuals might have had access to a local school, which usually meant local teachers, for better or worse. Today&#8217;s environment offers opportunities to listen to the best instructors in the world, all from your laptop. With these high-level educational opportunities, more and more people are mastering skills than ever before. This is especially true in hot fields like software engineering and computer science. What that leads to is an influx of candidates, all claiming to be ready and able to do the job. As that number continues to rise, the ability for recruiters to measure a bigger pool remains limited.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The stakes are higher than ever when it comes to recruiting because there is an increase of hidden gems in the applicant pool. These candidates may not present well on paper, but they&#8217;re highly qualified for the jobs. Recruiters are hearing from more applicants who say they&#8217;re skilled, but have fewer ways, like those outdated pedigrees, with which to validate who really is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This educational shift is driving the need to measure skills directly. Which means it is critical to have the right toolkit to determine who can perform well in the given job.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, how does your organization that has used the same recruiting process for years take the first step? How about by eliminating resumes today. The incoming pile of resumes continues to get bigger, and you can no longer determine who&#8217;s qualified from these outdated pieces of paper.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To replace the resume, you&#8217;ll typically need to introduce an assessment. There are many to choose from, so pick what works best for you. Once you have implemented a test, you can start measuring how recruits are actually performing in their jobs over time and continue fine-tuning the tools from there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Education impacts recruiting more and more as the gap between education and recruiting decreases. To find the most amazing people, we have to be able to measure skills, whether they came from an impressive Ivy League education or an online app. <br></p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Using assessments, especially at the top of your hiring funnel is a key component of making the selection process fair. But, with the introduction of assessments comes the need to validate the results you&#8217;re getting while avoiding any adverse impact.</p>
<p><iframe width="525" height="295" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/csObo_EQKoo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So, how do you avoid adverse impact or prove that you don&#8217;t have one inherently in the assessment itself? It&#8217;s an important question to ask, because companies that are subject to EEOC guidelines and other legal requirements have to be able to defend their results. There is a set of uniform guidelines to follow so ensuring you don&#8217;t have an adverse impact has to be a priority.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one of the big components of the process. <em>Reliability.</em> Simply put, it&#8217;s the concept of retesting and getting the same result. This might be with the same test, or with an updated version that has new questions.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say your organization sent the assessment to thirty candidates, of which you hired five. If you retested the same thirty people six months later and found dramatically different results, then the test is unreliable. But it&#8217;s more than just the assumed reliability; you have to be able to prove it. Without the ability to show that a retest would produce a highly consistent result, you cannot protect your test, or its output.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When it comes to regulatory guidelines, being unable to prove the reliability of your assessments can have consequences. You are legally responsible in those cases to ensure there is no adverse impact on a protected class, such as a particular race, sex or ethnic group. And this goes beyond your assessments. It&#8217;s an important factor that applies to any part of your hiring process.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Validity is another crucial component to the validation process, and it can be more complex to measure. The most common method in this category is the content related validation process. In this scenario, you would start with the job analysis and determine the key requirements of the role. What skills and knowledge are required of a candidate? Next, you have to be able to show that your questions, asked of any applicant, are measuring those specific skills or knowledge base. Determining whether assessment questions are measuring only the key required skills can be tough. And, there&#8217;s another method that&#8217;s introduced here, called Criterion Related Validation. It requires more time to analyze because it measures if the people who scored well and were hired, actually performed well on the job.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Usually, for reliable validation, you&#8217;ll need some expert advice. A professional can validate exactly what a particular question is measuring and verify that it is a required skill for the job. These secondary experts also defend your assessments and results, in court, if that situation ever occurs.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When it comes to assessments, remember that validation is not as easy as it sounds, and there are strict requirements to follow. Always start with a framework when developing your assessments and use experts when needed. When it&#8217;s working correctly, you&#8217;ll be hiring qualified candidates, and be able to defend how! </p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><iframe style="width: 740px; height: 416px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrGo2XfbVOs" width="740" height="416" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></figure>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When identifying talent data sources, it&#8217;s essential to focus on accessibility and accuracy. Just because a candidate may have one source readily available, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s highly accurate.  And those that are accurate may not be widely used. Let&#8217;s jump into the top five talent data sources and see how they rank.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Coursework and GPA</strong></p>
<p>These two data points are most relevant if you&#8217;re hiring current students or recent graduates. Because almost anyone who attended a school or took online courses will have them, they rank as a medium on the availability scale.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When it comes to accuracy, these measurements can be misleading. At more demanding schools, a C grade may indicate you studied and worked hard. Alternatively, some schools don&#8217;t offer challenging coursework, and all A&#8217;s could indicate an average student. This metric could be more accurate if you&#8217;re familiar with the school itself and its level of difficulty.  On the overall accuracy scale, it receives a medium. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>References and Referrals</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Referrals aren&#8217;t often readily available because you can&#8217;t ask for them upfront, unless you know the candidate fairly well or happen to know one of their colleagues. This becomes much less likely with high volume recruiting.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Even if you did ask and receive referrals or references, there&#8217;s a big potential for bias. Having someone gush about a candidate is valuable, but only if they worked closely with the individual and can offer concrete evidence of their skillset. In those cases, these tools can provide a lot of value.  For references and referrals, availability is low, but accuracy is high.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Competitions and Online Challenges</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Certain roles and environments, like a data scientist or university setting, are more likely to have exposure in these areas. While succeeding in a competition or online challenge is difficult to fake, very few people actually do them. They&#8217;re very hard, and even an experienced individual may not place in the top results. Plus, they&#8217;re often very public, and many don&#8217;t feel comfortable putting their name out there. This means the availability of data is limited. That leads to a low availability score but high for accuracy.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Resumes</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We can probably all answer the availability question when it comes to resumes &#8211; they are everywhere! Every applicant will likely produce a resume, but don&#8217;t assume that means it is accurate. Resumes, by their nature, allow the individual to fill in the details. A rich pedigree may help, but even that isn&#8217;t accurate because attendance at a top tier school can&#8217;t validate a direct skill. Resumes have a very high availability but low accuracy.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>LinkedIn</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Believe it or not, LinkedIn may rank higher than resumes for availability. This is because it&#8217;s not a part of the application process. Anyone can search and find your profile. And although LinkedIn encourages the use of endorsements, which you won&#8217;t find on a resume, they should not be readily trusted. You should expect to see less exaggeration on LinkedIn than a resume because it&#8217;s public and can more readily be validated. This leads to slightly higher accuracy and availability.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So, what about specialized sources for software developers?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Stack Overflow</strong> is a question and answer website and a common hotspot for software developers. Once online, however, most people are just consuming, not engaging. To have higher accuracy, and even availability, there has to be interaction. An updated profile and active participant in the platform will potentially have posted endorsements and various metrics by which to validate a skill. In those cases, it&#8217;s a much better signal than a resume when available.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>GitHub Inc.</strong> is a collaborative code community. The accuracy can be questionable because codes can be copied, and individuals typically only upload their best projects for display. And it&#8217;s not very high on availability. Again, just like Stack Overflow, an active user will offer more data than a disengaged one.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One data point that offers the highest level of accuracy is a direct measurement of skill. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not yet readily available, and just like references, you have to request it. With CodeSignal, we&#8217;re changing that and envision a scenario where candidates come through the door with certifications. Although we&#8217;re still in the early stages of this industry shift, we&#8217;re excited to see an increase in the availability of this highly accurate tool.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When you&#8217;re thinking about talent data sources, be sure to remember and assess the availability and accuracy of <em>any</em> given tool.  Although it’s great having something that is readily available, you&#8217;ll be compromising the value if it&#8217;s not accurate too.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><iframe style="width: 740px; height: 416px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kz9qn70eN7o" width="740" height="416" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></figure>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The future of resumes is changing, and we want it to be for the better. We’re jumping into the discussion and sharing what they could and should be, versus what options would only perpetuate the status quo.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, let’s look at virtual resumes. Similar to a mini-interview, video resumes are popping up, giving a candidate the ability to present themselves more fully than they ever could on paper. Here’s the problem – we can’t remove unconscious bias as a human, so when you evaluate someone for the first time by video, it is only going to make matters worse. At least with resumes, bias is limited to things like gender, name, school affiliation, etc. With video, we’re adding in appearance, the pitch of someone’s voice, the shape of their face (which believe it or not can signal to us “trustworthiness” based on our bias). Unless you&#8217;re hiring a TV anchor or the next Chris Hemsworth (and being comfortable in front of a camera matters) skip the video to minimize bias. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Look for ways to find, and evaluate, unbiased data about the candidate&#8217;s skills. An example might be a context-based resume that highlights particular skills. This doesn’t mean receiving a resume that has been altered to match a posted description. Instead, it could function more like a targeted ad. As an employer, you would be able to find the resumes with skill sets you want, to match the jobs you’re hiring for. Think of it like Google AdWords where what you search for is matched immediately with a relevant option. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are already companies in the recruiting industry that focus on sourcing information from keywords. They’re happy to come along and find the data for you, but remember it’s not changing the process. Instead, what you’ve done is improve the existing practice by making it faster or more automated. A collection of keywords can never truly recognize ability or potential. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The direct measure of ability is the most essential tool for the future. Direct measure of ability doesn’t allow you to make decisions based on proxies, like where the candidate went to school or what companies they’ve worked for. And that’s important because these outdated proxies are signaling tools that give an impression that someone is good at what they do, but in fact don’t accurately measure whether a candidate is qualified or not. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although no one can say for sure where resumes are headed, we know the new wave shouldn’t include videos. Instead, candidates should be evaluated with a direct measure of their skills. No resumes, no pictures, <em>maybe</em> even no names!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><iframe style="width: 740px; height: 416px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XtZl1o_PGUI" width="740" height="416" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></figure>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Working with Universities to identify and hire early talent has been an integral part of the recruiting process for many companies. As the industry shifts to become more data-driven, this area is a good place to discuss how changes should occur.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, let’s start with the current process. Most companies today have identified a list of schools they collaborate with and will recruit from. No matter how great the mascots are, there is a limited amount of time between career fairs and campus events so most companies work with 20 to 30 schools max.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regardless of the setting, the initial screening is most often a familiar piece of paper. As a student, you may put on your suit, head to the career fair and be ready to shake some hands, but even at live events, the resume is standard. When the event is over, recruiters leave with a big stack of papers they’ll review and sort later, long after first impressions of the candidates have passed. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here&#8217;s the first problem &#8211; you&#8217;ve already chosen the school based on some affiliation, whether geographical, status, etc. And now you have a big stack of resumes. Most students turned in a resume because it’s the practice, but they don’t have much to put on it yet. Instead, they’re filling up the paper with things like a current GPA. At first glance, that may seem like a useful metric, but it’s not always telling the full story. A student who takes a lot of easy classes should have higher grades, compared to the one who’s pushing the envelope to excel and challenge themselves. The latter may be the hardest worker, but on paper, all you notice is a lower GPA. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The reality is, you&#8217;ll miss a lot of great talent by opting to work with a few chosen schools. Here’s how we know. Research has proven that the top 2-3% of students at first-tier schools compare equally to the top 2-3% of third tier schools. By sticking with one school and reaching deeper down the distribution curve, you’ll be recruiting less qualified candidates than you would by widening the funnel to begin with. </p>

<p>If you agree with the logic but aren’t ready to ask your recruiters to spend every waking hour at a new school, there are options. The best way to solve this challenge is to get online! Handshake and WayUp are great alternatives to existing processes, offering everything from online career fairs to online job application portals. You can skip the resume screening and get instant access to a very large pool. You can also start with an assessment, which is what we recommend to eliminate bias from the start. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We set the bar high.” This is an important topic of discussion when it comes to recruiting and one that we hear discussed a lot. There’s a proud perception that comes with having a “high bar” for your organization. Clearly, no one wants to work for a company that broadcasts they have low standards! But, this elusive “high bar” could be working against you, especially when it comes to setting the bar for skill assessment. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How could having a high bar be a bad thing? You’re attracting the best quality candidates, right? Wrong. What you may be doing is limiting your applicant pool. By setting the bar too high, you’re eliminating potential employees that could have joined your organization and done a good job for you. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can also create another problem if the bar is set too low. Allowing a lot of people to enter the recruiting funnel – who aren’t qualified to do the job – can slow down your interview process and waste a lot of valuable time. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You want to hit the sweet spot when it comes to setting the bar, ensuring you don’t miss quality candidates or create a huge time suck in the recruiting department. So where do you start? Begin by assessing your company and the role itself. If you’re a large organization that can hire <em>and train</em> candidates to become a great team member, you may be willing to set the bar lower. It doesn’t mean you want to open the floodgates unnecessarily, but you can focus on measuring more fundamental skills. If you’re a smaller organization or start-up – where EVERY member counts and must hit the ground running – have a slightly higher bias and take your time to be selective. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another good way to determine where to set the bar is to gather data to avoid making evaluations in a bubble. Here’s why. Let’s say you ask candidates to take an assessment that operates on a scale of 0 to 100. You get the results of your first recruit and they’ve scored an 80 on the test. Great! <em>Right</em>? Well, without an evaluation against the candidate’s peers, how do you determine the value to place on the results? A score is just a number. Instead, look at how one score compares to the population who took the test. If only 5% of the population scored 80 or more, you might have a solid candidate. If 90% score 80 or more, it’s a different story.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When setting a bar for your assessment, remember it&#8217;s one dimensional. Don&#8217;t limit yourself to making a decision with only this information. And don&#8217;t fall into the trap of thinking that a high bar is always a <em>good</em> bar. </p>

<p>One of the main reasons to begin the process of going beyond resumes is to eliminate bias &#8211; while still measuring skills. It sounds straight-forward enough, but good intentions don&#8217;t always end the way we think they will. Instead, we find that when companies begin to focus on eliminating one form of bias, they can inadvertently introduce a new one. Not exactly a slam dunk.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s walk through how this could happen. Your team has acknowledged  that relying exclusively on resumes or pedigrees isn&#8217;t going to work anymore. It&#8217;s time to start measuring skills directly and implement assessments. So far, so good. The problem shows up when you begin to create those assessments. For example, you want to evaluate a candidate’s ability to write code by asking a question, framed in a particular context. The <em>context </em>of the question can very quickly introduce a bias against a particular demographic. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It’s a common problem, that isn’t just related to recruiting. In the world of education, the SAT is a standardized assessment to measure various skill sets. Although this test is widely accepted, it’s been shown that questions on the test reflect a bias. A question framed by a subject like football, for example, will instantly give an advantage to individuals who have knowledge in that area. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Your best bet for any assessment is to avoid topics that certain groups may have higher familiarity with. Which means the most obvious team to help you create an assessment (your team) may be part of the problem. Unintentionally, companies seek out veteran staff to provide input on standardized questions. But those long-term employees will prepare questions based on what they know to be true, not based on assessment creation skills or even equal employment guidelines. This can be complicated by the current state of a particular group. Let’s talk software engineers for a minute. We know that  group is already heavily skewed towards a specific demographic. It stands to reason that when you ask the current demographic to create questions that will attract new individuals, they’ll be framed by that group’s viewpoint. Which means you&#8217;re just reinforcing the vicious cycle of recruiting and hiring the same kinds of people.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Even with the best of intentions, your team may not be equipped or have the necessary training to create an unbiased assessment. Ideally, you want to work with professionals who have designed assessments and can help you avoid any landmines. They’ll instinctively know how to limit context and maintain EEOC compliance, ensuring you won’t be favoring one demographic over another.  </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Bias has many shapes and forms, and it&#8217;s easy to replace one type with another. Focus on receiving proper training or support and utilize third-party experts to ensure you can eliminate bias once and for all. </p>
