								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will we see you at Tech Inclusion (#TechInclusion) this year?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">October 15th, 2018, marks the kickoff of Tech Inclusion San Francisco 2018. Most of the recent diversity and inclusion initiatives in tech has been to consciously and actively select for people of more diverse backgrounds, which has made a significant impact. But what if we can completely remove conscious and unconscious bias all together? To achieve this, we must start from the first step: hiring. The key to removing biases is to make our assessments and processes as objective as possible and build it into our HR workflow. Today, we’ll talk about the impact of technologies that have been used to anonymize candidate information even before we start evaluating them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CodeSignal team is particularly excited about this year’s event because our CEO, Tigran Sloyan, is joining a panel on day two with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehul Patel, CEO of Hired.com, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lauren Ryan, VP of New Products at Greenhouse.io. They&#8217;ll be chatting about &#8220;how technology can completely remove biases from hiring&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are just a few reasons why you should join us.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Tech Inclusion San Francisco?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 will be the fourth annual occurrence of Tech Inclusion San Francisco, an event dedicated to furthering the causes of diversity and inclusion. This year’s theme is “Voices of Innovation,” which spotlights diverse and underrepresented voices who are shaping innovative technology of the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conference spans a three-day period (October 15th &#8211; 17th) and is packed full of educational and networking events for tech leaders, bootstrapping entrepreneurs, and nonprofit organizations. In addition, students and technical talent are invited to attend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For an hour-by-hour listing of all scheduled happenings, check out the </span><a href="https://sf18.techinclusion.co/#agenda"><span style="font-weight: 400;">detailed agenda</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Here’s a quick preview of what is planned for each day:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Day 1 (Monday, October 15):</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doors open at 8 am. Attendees can choose from a variety of workshops, breakout sessions, and presentations that run through early afternoon.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Day 2 (Tuesday, October 16):</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doors open at 8 am. Keynote presentations and panels begin mid-morning and run through late afternoon. Happy hour begins at 5 pm and ends at 7 pm.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Day 3 (Wednesday, October 17): </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third and final day is primarily focused on the career fair, which begins at 11 am and concludes at 3 pm. After networking with fellow tech companies, developers, and educational institutions, be sure to stop by the Mezzanine Level for a free headshot. Several workshops are also scheduled for Wednesday.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who Should Attend Tech Inclusion San Francisco?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech Inclusion San Francisco is an excellent opportunity for anyone who works (or aspires to work) in the technology industry. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founders &amp; Tech Leaders:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn best practices for building a more inclusive company culture by interacting with top CEOs, including Greg Clark of Symantec, Mehul Patel of Hired, Melinda Briana Epler of Change Catalyst, Danielle DeRuiter-Williams of The Justice Collective, and our very own Tigran Sloyan of CodeSignal. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiring Managers:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engage in thought-provoking sessions that will challenge the status quo within your hiring organization. Be sure to attend the keynote facilitated by our CEO, Tigran Sloyan, titled “How Technology Can Remove Biases from Hiring.” By attending this panel, you’ll get an action-oriented game plan for removing conscious and unconscious biases from your hiring workflow. You’ll also learn how to leverage technology to create assessments and processes, resulting in a more diverse and inclusive workforce.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Talent:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech Inclusion San Francisco isn’t just for management-level staff. Developers and programmers are also encouraged to participate in the conversation. Choose from workshops on a variety of topics, such as creating more “inclusive” products, collaborating for true change, cyber security and culture, protecting human rights in the age of AI, and much more.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The career fair on Wednesday, October 17th, is a great chance for students to establish connections with tech employers. Well-respected technological schools will also be represented at the career fair.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connect with CodeSignal at Tech Inclusion 2018</span></h2>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we launched back in 2014, we’ve created a diverse community of developers who learn new coding skills and practice for technical interviews on our platform every day. &nbsp;We learned a lot over these years and one of our top priorities is still to make our platform as useful to our users as possible. We want our brand and our products to best reflect why we exist, what we believe in, and where we’re headed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So below are three important launches effective today <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>New Name</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may have noticed, that as of today, we changed our name from CodeFights to CodeSignal. We believe that our new name, CodeSignal, better reflects our continued focus on measuring technical skills and adding unbiased skills data to the recruiting process. Our goal is to ensure that we can provide a completely objective way of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">signaling</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your level of skill to those that matter (get it? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />). </span></p>
<p><b>New Coding Score</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are also excited to announce the CodeSignal Coding Score! Under your new dedicated “My Profile” tab, you’ll find a new section called “Coding Score”. This score is an overall measurement of your implementation and problem-solving abilities and a predictor of how you will perform in technical interviews. Whether you’re measuring your own skills as you learn new ones, comparing your skills to those of your friends, or finding a new job; the CodeSignal Coding Score will be your way of showing your skills to the world. &nbsp;</span><a href="https://app.codesignal.com/coding-score/faq"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about your Coding Score</span></a></p>
<p><b>New User Profile</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve also created a whole new User Profile to highlight your coding skills and make it more useful, especially if you’re interviewing. Now, you can update your profile, control your privacy settings, and most importantly, share your profile link with potential employers. From now on, you can use your CodeSignal profile as your Developer Resume. &nbsp;</span><a href="https://app.codesignal.com/login"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Login to see your new profile!</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s even more announcements just around the corner. But in the meantime, Happy Coding!</span></p>
